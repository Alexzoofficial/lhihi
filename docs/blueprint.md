## Core Features:

- Contextual Understanding: Analyzes input, mimicking ChatGPT's understanding, using internet-derived information as a tool to provide coherent replies.

- UI Replication: Replicates the UI and UX elements of ChatGPT, including chat interface and settings panel.
- Mobile and Desktop Responsiveness: Ensures the UI adapts flawlessly to various screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience across mobile and desktop platforms.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Off-white (#F0F0F0) provides a neutral backdrop that reduces eye strain during long conversations.
- Primary color: A deep shade of green (#34A853) which invokes feelings of knowledge, growth, and responsiveness, much like ChatGPT itself.
- Accent color: Light gray (#9AA0A6) used sparingly for interactive elements, this maintains clarity without drawing too much attention.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' for body text and headlines, a sans-serif providing excellent readability on various screen sizes.
- Use minimalistic, functional icons for actions and settings. These are designed to be clear, even at small sizes, without distracting from the main chat area.
- Maintain a clean, single-column layout for the chat interface. Input box and submit button fixed at the bottom for ease of access across devices.
- Subtle transition effects when loading messages and adjusting settings. These micro-animations should be smooth and quick, ensuring they do not hinder performance or distract the user.
